# Tailwind CSS Fix Guide

## ✅ **Issue Resolved!**

The Tailwind CSS issue has been fixed. Here's what was done:

### 🔧 **Changes Made:**

1. **Updated CSS Import Method** - Changed from separate `@tailwind` directives to single `@import "tailwindcss"`
2. **Removed Duplicate CSS** - Eliminated duplicate button definitions that were causing conflicts
3. **Simplified CSS Structure** - Consolidated all styles into a single, clean CSS file
4. **Updated Vite Configuration** - Removed reference to deleted validation.css file
5. **Cleared Caches** - Cleared view and config caches to ensure fresh loading

### 📁 **Files Modified:**

- `resources/css/app.css` - Recreated with proper Tailwind v4 syntax
- `vite.config.js` - Updated input files
- `routes/web.php` - Added test route
