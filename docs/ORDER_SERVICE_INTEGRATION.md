# Order Service Integration Documentation

## Overview

The OrderService has been successfully implemented to handle order creation and inventory management with automated low-stock notifications. This service integrates seamlessly with the existing InventoryService to provide a complete order processing solution.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Order Creation from Cart
- Creates orders from user's cart items
- Validates inventory availability before processing
- Automatically decrements inventory quantities
- Clears cart after successful order creation
- Sends order confirmation emails

### 2. Direct Order Creation
- Creates orders with specific items (not from cart)
- Validates product existence and stock availability
- Handles inventory updates with database transactions

### 3. Inventory Management Integration
- Automatic inventory decrement during order creation
- Low-stock notification triggers after inventory updates
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Inventory restoration on order cancellation

### 4. Order Status Management
- Update order status (pending, paid, shipped, cancelled)
- Order cancellation with inventory restoration
- Order statistics and reporting

### 5. Email Notifications
- Order confirmation emails with detailed order information
- Responsive email templates with UrPearl branding
- Queued email processing for performance

## Service Architecture

```php
OrderService
├── createOrderFromCart()     // Creates order from user's cart
├── createOrder()            // Creates order with specific items
├── updateOrderStatus()      // Updates order status
├── cancelOrder()           // Cancels order and restores inventory
└── getOrderStats()         // Returns order statistics
```

## Integration with InventoryService

The OrderService uses the InventoryService for all inventory operations:

1. **Stock Validation**: Checks if sufficient stock is available
2. **Inventory Decrement**: Reduces stock quantities when orders are created
3. **Low-Stock Detection**: Automatically triggers notifications when stock falls below threshold
4. **Inventory Restoration**: Restores stock when orders are cancelled

## Database Transactions

All order operations use database transactions to ensure data consistency:

```php
DB::transaction(function () {
    // Create order
    // Create order items
    // Decrement inventory
    // Clear cart
    // Send notifications
});
```

## Error Handling

The service includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Empty Cart**: Throws exception if cart is empty
- **Insufficient Stock**: Validates stock availability before processing
- **Product Not Found**: Validates product existence
- **Database Errors**: Rolls back transactions on failures
- **Email Failures**: Logs errors but doesn't fail order creation

## Email Templates

Order confirmation emails include:

- Order details and status
- Itemized product list with images
- Shipping address information
- Order progress tracking
- Responsive design with UrPearl branding

## Controller Integration

The OrderController provides web interface for:

- Order history listing
- Order detail views
- Order confirmation pages
- Order cancellation functionality

## Routes

```php
GET  /orders                    // Order history
GET  /orders/{order}           // Order details
GET  /orders/{order}/confirmation // Order confirmation
PATCH /orders/{order}/cancel   // Cancel order
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:

- Unit tests for OrderService methods
- Integration tests for inventory management
- Feature tests for complete order workflows
- Email notification testing

## Usage Examples

### Creating Order from Cart

```php
$orderService = new OrderService($inventoryService);

$order = $orderService->createOrderFromCart(
    $user,
    $shippingAddress,
    $stripePaymentId
);
```

### Creating Direct Order

```php
$items = [
    ['product_id' => 1, 'quantity' => 2],
    ['product_id' => 2, 'quantity' => 1],
];

$order = $orderService->createOrder(
    $user,
    $items,
    $shippingAddress
);
```

### Cancelling Order

```php
$orderService->cancelOrder($order);
// Automatically restores inventory
```

## Low-Stock Notification Flow

1. Order is created and inventory is decremented
2. InventoryService checks if quantity <= threshold
3. If low stock detected, notification is created for admin users
4. Email notification is sent to admin users
5. Admin can view notifications in dashboard

## Performance Considerations

- Database transactions ensure atomicity
- Email sending is queued for better performance
- Bulk operations supported for inventory updates
- Efficient queries with proper relationships loaded

## Security Features

- User authorization checks (users can only access their orders)
- Input validation for all order data
- SQL injection protection through Eloquent ORM
- CSRF protection on all forms

## Future Enhancements

The service is designed to be extensible for future features:

- Order tracking integration
- Multiple payment method support
- Partial order cancellations
- Order modification capabilities
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- **3.5**: Order creation with inventory decrement operations ✅
- **3.6**: Database transactions for order/inventory consistency ✅
- **4.2**: Order status management ✅
- **6.1**: Automatic low-stock notification triggers ✅
- **6.2**: Email notifications for order confirmations ✅

## Conclusion

The OrderService provides a robust, scalable solution for order management with seamless inventory integration. The service handles all aspects of order processing while maintaining data consistency and providing excellent user experience through comprehensive error handling and email notifications.
